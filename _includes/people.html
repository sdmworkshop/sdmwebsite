          <p><a href="https://savir.net.technion.ac.il/"> Prof. Yonatan (Yoni) Savir</a> received his Bachelor’s degree from the Technion in the program for dual degrees in Electrical Engineering and Physics, summa cum laude. He completed his Ph.D. in physics of complex systems from the Weizmann Institute, where he studied the principles of information processing in biological systems. Prof. Savir did his postdoctoral training as a HFSP fellow at the Dept. of Systems Biology at Harvard Medical School, where he studied how biological systems cope with multiple signals at the same time. The research in his lab, at the Dept. of Biophysics and Systems Biology at the Faculty of Medicine at the Technion, is devoted to understanding how age affects the ability of systems, such as microorganisms, immune cells, and the mammalian embryo, to carry out functions. The Savir lab takes an interdisciplinary approach and uses tools from experimental biology (microfluidics, single-cell omics) and Engineering (mathematical modeling, deep learning). Prof. Savir has received many prestigious awards, including the Lee Segal prize for theoretical biology, the Alon fellowship, and the American Federation for Aging Research (AFAR) young investigator award. Prof. Savir has vast experience in harnessing artificial intelligence for health applications, is a co-founder of a few startups, and consults to BioTech companies.</p>

          <p><a href="https://bishesh.github.io/"> Dr. Bishesh Khanal</a> is a full-time Research Scientist and Director at NAAMII. Bishesh Khanal is interested in pushing the boundaries of Machine learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in both theory and applications with particular interest in applications relevant to Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). Bishesh Khanal lead a research group TOGAI within NAAMII: TransfOrming Global health with AI. At TOGAI they focus on developing and applying biomedical computer vision methods that are relevant for low-cost medical imaging solutions, including smart-phone solutions, and on improving Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Nepali language to enable the use of chatbots, voice bots, and automated processing of clinical reports for health care applications. Bishesh Khanal's interest lies in identifying and working on clinical translational research projects relevant to resource-constrained settings of the least developed world.</p>

He leads the Machine Intelligence in Medical Imaging research group at Stanford and has a primary research interest that lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence and medical imaging. His group develops new techniques for accelerated MRI acquisition and downstream image analysis, extracting prognostic insights from already-acquired CT imaging, and developing new multi-modal deep learning algorithms for healthcare that leverage computer vision, natural language, and medical records. Dr. Chaudhari has won the W.S. Moore Young Investigator Award and the Junior Fellow Award from the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine. Dr. Chaudhari has also been inducted into the Academy of Radiology’s Council of Early Career Investigators in Imaging program. He also serves as the Associate Director of Research and Education at the Stanford AIMI Center and is an advisory board member of the Precision Health and Integrated Diagnostics Center.</p>
