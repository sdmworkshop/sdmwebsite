          <h3>Motivation</h3>
          <p>
            Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have shown remarkable success in the medical imaging field, such as medical image analysis and diagnostic decision support systems. Yet, AI/ML solutions in real-world medical imaging scenarios remain challenging due to the demand of considerable amounts of curated data, while the availability of diverse, unbiased and representative training data is limited. An emerging approach to address this challenge involves the utilization of synthetic data machines (SDMs), contributing to the enhancement and validation of AI algorithms by supplementing existing datasets. 
			The main theme of our workshop is the opportunities and challenges of applying SDM in medical imaging, with a special focus on the role of multimodal data (imaging, EMR data and descriptive text) and computational modeling of SDM. Specifically, SDM 2024 pays attention to promote the community of researchers that are interested in leveraging the power of synthetic data to build the next generation AI solutions in HealthCare Tech, improving patients' outcomes. Our proposed program provides a space to discuss pathways for using multimodal Generative AI to improve AI reliability and explainability in Medicine in general, and particularly in computational biology, digital pathology, cardiovascular medicine, radiology, neuroscience, drug discovery, global women's health, and many other areas of healthcare.
			SDM 2024 will be a full-day hybrid in-person/virtual workshop with several keynote speeches, and oral/poster/spotlight presentations, followed by a breakout discussion, panel discussion, and best paper award announcement.
